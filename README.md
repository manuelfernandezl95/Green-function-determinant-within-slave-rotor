# Green-function-determinant-within-slave-rotor
The non-local Green's function determinant within the slave-rotor framework for a 3D nodal-line Mott insulator motivated by  (ET)⁢Ag4⁢(CN)5 molecular compound. The in-gap zeros delineate the spinon nodal-line dispersion inherited from the non-interacting band structure. This code can be adapted to any two-band system. 
This code has been used to obtain the results (in particular Fig. 10) published in the paper: "Topological strongly correlated phases in orthorhombic diamond lattice compounds" DOI: https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevB.111.165133
